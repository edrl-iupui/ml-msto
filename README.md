Machine learning-based multiscale topology optimization

By: Joel Najmon and Andres Tovar

This is a MATLAB code repository for the machine learning-based multiscale topology optimization (ML-MSTO) method proposed in the 2023 journal paper: "Multiscale Topology Optimization via Artificial Neural Netowrks and Displacement-driven Toplogy-optimized Microstructures" submitted to Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (SMO). The paper is currently under review.
